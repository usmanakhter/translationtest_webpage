"Consultant Instructions:
- If Commission amounts should be pulled from Compensation, update worker eligibility, change calculation and add the appropriate compensation element
- Verify that the earning should be included in 'Withholding Order (All): Periodic Earnings' PCG"
"ADDITIONAL INFO:
Imputed income for employer-paid coverage of children for group term life insurance (over $2,000).

The rate is set to $.05 because all dependents fall in the lower age bracket of the IRS table.  If the IRS changes the rates, the amount needs to be changed on the rate.

Amount added to taxable wages, but incremental taxes are not withheld for federal/state/local."
